### Chocolate Puddle Cakes

> That this cake has **6 ingredients**, basically pantry staples? That it takes **5 minutes** to assemble in a **single** bowl, and **7 to bake**?

-   Ingredients:
    -   4 tablespoons (55 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks, plus more for dishes
    -   2 teaspoons cocoa powder, plus more for dusting
    -   3 ounces (85 grams) bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped
    -   1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt or a couple pinches of flaky salt
    -   1 to 2 tablespoons (13 to 25 grams) granulated sugar (see Note)
    -   1 large egg
    -   1 egg yolk

 

-   Kitchen tools: Basically pantry stapples. Oven, bowls and other common tools will be needed.

 

-   Steps:
    1.  Molten center: simply spoon in half the batter, add your filling in centered dollop, spoon the remaining batter on top. The *sugar* is a bit variable here.
    2.  Heat oven to 450 degrees F.
    3.  Butter two 6-ounce ramekins or baking cups, making sure not to miss any spots. Spoon a little cocoa powder in each and pat it around so it coats the bottom and sides, then knock the excess out.
    4.  Place 4 tablespoons butter and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and — either in the microwave or set over a pot of gently simmering water — melt the butter and chocolate about two-thirds of the way, then whisk until it finishes melting.

    5.  Whisk in sugar and salt. Whisk in egg and yolk and beat a good 20 to 30 extra times, to ensure mixture is smooth, glossy, and a bit lightened. Add 2 teaspoons cocoa powder and whisk until combined.

    6.  Divide between two baking dishes. Bake 7 to 9 minutes (7 will be the most molten in the center, 9 the least but still gooey) and transfer to a cooling rack for 1 minute.

    7.  Wearing pot holders, place a small dessert plate over your first ramekin. Flip it onto the plate, count to ten, then lift the cup off.

    8.  Repeat with second cake. Dust with cocoa powder or powdered sugar. Serve with barely sweetened whipped cream, a little ice cream, berries, or absolutely nothing at all.
    9.  **Eat immediately**.

    **Do ahead**: You can make the batter and fill the prepared cups, then refrigerate until you want to bake them. They can go into the oven directly from the fridge, but will need to bake 1 to 2 minutes longer.

 

-   Special season? Enjoy it at any time!

 

-   Variations? Using other ingredients? you can put a spoonful of **almost anything** in the middle *(Nutella, cold butterscotch or caramel sauce or these caramel squares, raspberry sauce, not to mention all of the ways you can flavor chocolate, such as with espresso powder, mint extract, citrus zest, and more)* and it will become one with the molten center upon baking and everyone will think you are even more of a magician. In *Step 1*,the **sugar** is a bit variable. With a solidly bittersweet **chocolate** bar (70 to 72%), 1 tablespoon sugar is preferred, although 2 tablespoons is closer to the standard amount. With less bittersweet/more semisweet chocolate (60%), skipping it is ok. If you’re using **salted butter**, you can skip the additional **salt**, or just add a pinch of flakes for crunch.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the **line segment** connecting them ($ $).

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p1, p2,..., pn) and q = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in **Euclidean n-space**, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
\\begin{align\*} 
d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q}) =  d(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) &= \\sqrt{(q\_{1}-p\_{1})^{2}+(q\_{2}-p\_{2})^{2}+\\cdots+(q\_{n}-p\_{n})^{2}} \\\\ 
&= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_{i}-p\_{i})^{2}}. 
\\end{align\*}
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a **Euclidean vector**. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$
\\|\\mathbf{p}\\| = \\sqrt{q\_{1}^{2} + q\_{2}^{2} + \\cdots + q\_{n}^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}}
$$

where the last expression involves the **dot product**.
